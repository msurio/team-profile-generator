Unit 10 Team Profile Generator

## Overview

* In this unit's assignment, you will create an application which generates html files using input from a command line interface.

* In this unit, we will discuss JavaScript's brand of OOP by introducing constructors and the prototype chain. Constructors are special functions that are extremely useful in creating objects of similar types. Prototypes are JavaScriptâ€™s built in system, allowing objects to inherit features from other objects. Prototypes are considered by many to be an advanced JavaScript topic and mastering it will be sure to give you an extra edge as a JavaScript developer.

* We will cover test driven-development (TDD). When practicing TDD, we first write tests for application features before writing any code. Then, we write only the minimum amount of code needed to make the tests pass and repeat this process until the application is complete. Test-driven development has numerous benefits but ultimately helps us write more understandable and maintainable code.

* We will conclude this unit with an introduction to modern class syntax and inheritance. ES6 introduced a `class` keyword which allows us to create objects using class structures similar to those found in other OOP programming languages. Under the hood, classes are just constructor functions with more intuitive syntax. They allow us to implement more advanced OOP patterns such as inheritance without needing to understand all of the nuances of JavaScript's prototypal inheritance system.
